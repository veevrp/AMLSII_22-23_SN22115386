AMLSII Final Assignment: Image super-resolution using machine learning (SRGAN).

This repository contains works on 
[NTIRE2017 challenge](https://data.vision.ee.ethz.ch/cvl/ntire17//), image super-resolution.
There are 2 tasks on this work, A and B, which represents track 1 and track 2 from the challenge.

## Task A: Bicubic downscaling images
- uses the bicubic downscaling (Matlab imresize).

\* *Due to limited resources, it is decided to use*
- *[bicubic downscaling x2 images](http://data.vision.ee.ethz.ch/cvl/DIV2K/DIV2K_train_LR_bicubic_X2.zip) as high resolution images.*
- *[bicubic downscaling x4 images](http://data.vision.ee.ethz.ch/cvl/DIV2K/DIV2K_train_LR_bicubic_X4.zip) as low resolution images.*

## Task B: Unknown downscaling images
- assumes that the explicit forms for the degradation operators are unknown.

\* *Due to limited resources, it is decided to use*
- *[bicubic downscaling x2 images](http://data.vision.ee.ethz.ch/cvl/DIV2K/DIV2K_train_LR_bicubic_X2.zip) as high resolution images.*
- *[unknown downscaling x4 images](http://data.vision.ee.ethz.ch/cvl/DIV2K/DIV2K_train_LR_unknown_X4.zip) as low resolution images.*
